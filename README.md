I was looking for a set of files to test a JSON parser and found a
link to [http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/test.zip]. Although not
mentioned on the front page (there are no interior links, not even a
contact!), I used the files anyway. However, some of them have
problems.

I also found
[https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-test-suite/downloads] but
haven't looked at it yet.

## Issues with the tests

* fail26.json looks like it should have literal tabs (escaped), but the file has spaces.
* fail18.json checks for depth, but there's no requirement that something fail for that. Some parsers do limit that, but it's not a JSON spec

## Some links

* [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) - The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format
* [JSON.org](https://json.org)


## License

You can use my work under the Artistic License 2.0.

These files came to me with no note of a license, but the
[JSON Checker code](http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/). I don't think
this is a valid license since the terms "Good" and "Evil" aren't defined.
Some people already think JavaScript is evil. So how woudl that work?
