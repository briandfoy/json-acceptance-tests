I was looking for a set of files to test a JSON parser and found a
link to [http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/test.zip]. Although not
mentioned on the front page (there are no interior links, not even a contact!),
I used the files anyway. However, some of them have problems.

I also found [https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-test-suite/downloads] but
haven't looked at it yet.
